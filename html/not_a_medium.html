			<p>Illuminated Manuscripts, radio, the novel, the Internet - all media, you might think.  But thinking of Internet as medium doesn't make sense in all kinds of ways.</p>
			
			<p>This page explores two definitions of what distinguishes one medium from another. Under either analysis, the Internet is not a medium.</p>

			<h2>Defining media by similarity</h2>
			<p>A medium is a method of transmitting messages where all the messages transmitted by that medium have similar features.
			
			<p>TV is a particular mixture of moving image and sound, therefore we think of it as a medium, while magazines are a particular combination of images and text.</p>
			
			<p>Some aspects of a medium are to do with physical constraints, there are no moving pictures in a newspapers because there can't be.</p>
			
			<p>Other features of a medium are set by convention. Radio is conversational in a way that TV never is. </p>
			
			<p>Nothing marks the acceptance of a convention into public consciousness like it's becoming the butt of a joke. In the below clip we can see Monty Python satarising the way 70s TV used film cameras for outside shots, and TV cameras inside.</p>

			<h2>Defining media by their target</h2>
			
			<p>This must be the broadest definition of what a media is - something which has a human audience.</p>
			
			<p>Yet the Internet doesn't meet even this criteria! Machine --> Machine interaction</p>

			<h2>Unwarranted generalisations about the Internet</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Often people speak of the Internet as though it is one medium, and their claims need to be made more specific. "People who use the Internet for 4 hours a day have lower attention spans" doesn't really mean anything - what are they using the internet for? That's the critical fact, otherwise it's about as broad as saying "people engaged in activities for 4 hours a day have lower attention spans".</li>

		    	<li>Erroneous assumptions that generic properties of the Internet exist. It's also common to hear statements such as "the Internet is democratising". Obviously this is widely debated, and that debate could proceed with more if the language was tightened up. What features of the net are democratising?</li>

		    	<li>'First-TV-programme syndrome' - When the first TV programmes were broadcast they simply pointed cameras at people doing radio shows. It took time to work out what could be done with the new technology. Clearly we're on that same curve with the Internet. Being careful about what we're referring to can only help.
