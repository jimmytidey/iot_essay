		<div id='intro'>
			<h2>Two ways of thinking</h2>
			
			<p>It's often said that that Japanese people have a particular affinity for understanding robots, and technology at large, because the native Shinto religion assigns a spirit to everything, even inanimate objects.</p>  

			<p>My premise is that the brain is structured to understand things in in two different ways, one psychological, one physical.</p>


		</div>


		<div id='right'>

			<h2>Psychological</h2>
			<p>It's well established that humans have a "Theory of Mind". Which is to say, a special reasoning process which assumes that the behaviour of others is explicable by assuming that they have a mind similar to their own. <a href='#note_1'>[1]</a></p>

			<p>Autistic children are commonly said not to have a Theory of Mind, that is, they do not have a mental model for the way other people think. <a href='#note_2'>[2]</a></p>

 			<h2>Physical</h2>

			<p>Even very young children understand the physical world in a deep way [3]. Whether this is innate or not (all the evidence seems to suggest so), it's clear that humans are intuitively good at physics.  Calculating where a ball will land, and factoring in air resistance, leads to some complex maths. However, most people can catch a ball without difficulty</p>

			<p>If I were to put this difference in an anecdote, I would say that to throw a rock at someone requires you to understand physics. To realise they might get annoyed and throw it back at you requires an understanding of mind.</p>

		<div class='spectral_line' id='animism'>
			<h2>Animism</h2>
			<p><em>Mind stuff is pervasive</em></p>
			<p>Projection of psychological features onto everything, since there are few scientific ideas to make sense of the world.
				<ul>
					<li>Aboriginal "dreamtime" Cosmogony</li> 
					<li>Beliefs that plants, animals or places have human spirits</li>
				</ul>		
			</p> 			
		</div>

		
		<div class='spectral_line' id='implicit_dualism'>		
			<h2>Implicit Dualism</h2>
			<p><em>Mind-stuff is pure and perfect, physical-stuff is secondary</em><p>
			<p>Emergence of mathematics, deeper thought and complex mental models of the world convince physical stuff is not to be trusted. 
				<ul>
					<li>Plato's theory of forms asks us to look beyond physical-stuff to the true forms - mind-stuff</li>
				</ul>	 
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='spectral_line' id='explicit_dualism'>
			<h2>Cartesian Explicit Dualism</h2>
			<p><em>Mind-matter and physical are formally separately identified for the first time.</em></p>
			<p>Descartes was the first philosopher to make dualism explicit. His view was that since we can imagine a mind without a body, and a body without a mind, they must be two separate things.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='spectral_line' id='psychological_dualism'>
			<h2>Psychological Dualism</h2> 
			<p><em>Science and technology erode the uniqueness of mental-matter</em></p>
			<p>Properties considered unique to mental-matter are shown not to be. Despite this, we still treat the two types of matter as separate in our everyday thought.
				<ul>	
					<li>Babbage and automata</li>
					<li>Turing and the Turing test</li>
					<li>fMRI scanning and free will</li>
					<li>Spell checking</li>
				<ul>
			<p>			
		</div>
		
		<div class='spectral_line' id='materialism'>
			<h2>Materialism</h2>
			<p>In the future, just as humans once accepted an animistic or rationalist view of the world, we will accept that the only thing that exists is physical-stuff.
			<ul>
				<li>Dan Dennett's materialism</li> 
				<li>Nick Bostrom and his transhumanism</li>
